#Description
It's displaying on a screen the quantity and the percent fill of containers or hub.

It can support up to 9 screens and chose what is display on each (group feature)

To add a container to the system, you must rename it following that pattern: `<prefix>_<itemName>`
For a Hub, you must use that pattern: `<prefix>_<itemName>_<containserSize>_<amountOfContainers>`

- `<prefix>`: the prefix that enable monitoring, by default `MONIT`, see options to customize it
- `<itemName`: the real item name in english
- `<containerSize>`: if a hub, the size of the containers linked (default to XS)
- `<amountOfContainers>`: if a hub, the amount of containers linked

By default, the script is grouping all containers or hub that contains the same items on a single line and add the values. See option if you want to disable it.

By default, the list is sorted by item tier and then by name
